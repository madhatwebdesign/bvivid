            <h1>About us</h1>

            <p>Let’s start with a few words about you:</p>

            <p>You sell. You sell to customers, pitch investors, cultivate partners and align employees.</p>

            <p>You sell into markets that are noisy; everyone is pitching and everyone’s being pitched. Because many priorities compete for their time, buyers, investors, partners and employees have evolved an internal stopwatch. They’ll give you ten seconds to earn the next ten seconds.</p>

            <p>We’ll help you beat the clock. Each year, hundreds of mundane decks take a detour en route to the market ─ stopping here, where we transform them. Working closely with our clients, we turn them into presentations so compelling they move targets to respond. Follow-up meetings replace polite nods, yielding more customer wins and investment.</p>

            <p>Advertising creates awareness and PR can suggest validity, but only personal selling will close a B2B sale. That’s where we come in. We produce VIVID: marketing-and-sales communications that are crisp, evocative, and hard to ignore. From presentations to customer success stories and keynotes to collateral, the tools we create will help you spark and sustain the conversations you must nurture to close sales, spur investment, build alliances and inspire employees.</p>

                      Smart TVs, distilled the complexities of media
                      measurement into a series of vivid decks designed to
                      answer one question: With set-top-box data and Nielsen
                      ratings so widely used, why would broadcasters
                      need more insights into what’s on each screen?
                      </p><br>
                      <p>The answer boils down to this: “Showtime” is vastly
                        more profitable when networks know who’s watching
                        in <em>real</em> time.

                        <p>When companies have unhappy customers, impatient
                        vendors and frustrated employees, one culprit is typically
                        at fault: disconnects across the enterprise ─ gaps where
                        integrations and automations should be.</p><br>

                        <p>In a white paper by bVIVID, Kapow Software shows how
                        Integration as a Self-Service™ fixes that by turning
                        business-process flows into immediate, executable
                        software automation code. With this agile way of connecting
                        applications, stakeholders can run the integrations

                        <p>bVIVID may well set the gold standard for white papers:

                        <p>Supplier Management is unique among functions because

                        Validate tax IDs, collect W-8s... this isn’t rocket science.
                        And yet, too many companies rely on manual processes

                        <p>It’s simple chemistry: A dirt stain isn’t an ink stain
                        and an ink stain isn’t a wine stain. Enter Delta
                        Pronatura’s Carbona Stain Devils, nine products
                        each formulated to remove a certain type of stain.
                        But how to get trade buyers to pay attention, especially
                        in the din of the International Home + Housewares Show?
                        It was here where Stain Devils debuted from a tiny booth
                        tucked into a corner of Chicago’s McCormick Place.</p><br>

                        <p>bVIVID sent each buyer a luxurious white shirt ─ Gucci for
                        the women, Brioni for the men ─ all in pristine condition,
                        but for one tragic flaw: a red-wine stain. Inside the box, a
                        note from Delta Pronatura: “Join us at booth 919. We’ll
                        take the stain, you keep the shirt!”</p><br>

                        <p>Today, Stain Devils occupy shelf space across the U.S.,
                        from Ace Hardware to Walmart Supercenters.</p>

              <p>What a difference a day makes!</p><br>

              <p>How to prolong current growth while building its
               next stage? Give us a day, Deloitte tells clients,
               and we’ll take you a giant step forward. Its method is a tool called DeepDive™ – a mix of
               brainstorming, prototyping and feedback loops –
               through which strategy meetings become remarkable
               exchanges; the one day that sets up years of growth.</p><br>

               <p>Engaged to market this initiative through collateral and other means, bVIVID saw this:
                With its candid, high-velocity interactions,
                DeepDive™ is more than a meeting – it’s a bona
                fide intervention to harness the collective IQ.</p>

                      <p>Ok, life is like a box of chocolates. But a great
                      presentation is like a strand of pearls: each slide
                      is a gem and together they make a statement.</p><br>

                      <p>The statement we helped craft for Cognitive Networks,
                      providers of content-recognition technology for
                      Smart TVs, distilled the complexities of media
                      measurement into a series of vivid decks designed to
                      answer one question: With set-top-box data and Nielsen
                      ratings so widely used, why would broadcasters
                      need more insights into what’s on each screen?</p><br>

                      <p>The answer boils down to this: “Showtime” is vastly
                        more profitable when networks know who’s watching
                        in <em>real</em> time.</p>

          <h3>PEPSICO</h3><hr class="hrblue">

                        <p>China’s consumer markets don't exist for the taking; a seller has to
                        offer added value. When the seller is PepsiCo, no offer is
                        more valuable than help in purifying drinking water.</p><br>

                        <p>Eager to embed itself in China's ascent, PepsiCo has invested
                        vigorously to bring clean water to the country’s neediest
                        regions. When PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi planned her first visit
                        as CEO, she tapped bVIVID to write her keynote ─ a moving

                        most populous nation.</p><br>

                        Global B2B 2000. The article we wrote for Joe ─ a reasoned

                        spoke powerfully to Vendavo’s targets and struck a chord with

                        <p>When companies have unhappy customers, impatient
                        vendors and frustrated employees, one culprit is typically
                        at fault: disconnects across the enterprise ─ gaps where
                        integrations and automations should be.</p><br>

                        <p>In a white paper by bVIVID, Kapow Software shows how
                        Integration as a Self-Service™ fixes that by turning
                        business-process flows into immediate, executable
                        software automation code. With this agile way of connecting

                        and automations they need to do their best work.</p><br>

                        <p>bVIVID may well set the gold standard for white papers:

                        Validate tax IDs, collect W-8s... this isn’t rocket science.
                        And yet, too many companies rely on manual processes
                        that compromise compliance – exposing themselves to

                        <p>Prospecting emails earn average response of two to five

                        <p>As Oracle’s Marketing VP, Frank Prestipino initiated

                        go-to-market strategy; changes that, in aggregate,
                        drove profitable growth. So when Frank expressed
                        interest in writing a book about how small, low-risk
                        changes can spawn big results, we committed
                        to get it published. bVIVID wrote the book proposal,

Because whether you're pitching customers, investors or your own senior management, high-value targets are elusive. Give them strong reasons to say "yes" or they will likely say "no" by default.</p>
